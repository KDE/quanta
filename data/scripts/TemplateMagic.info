<about>This is mostly written by Robert and a result of a collaboration to enhance Quanta templates and demonstrate usees for Kommander.

You can identify fields in your templates in square brackets by [fieldname:type] where type is text, file or filename. File and filename being different in either contents or name. The fields will be replaced with template insertion. This works with text and file templates. Other fields and functionality are planned. If you enhance this script please send us a copy.</about>
