            <p>
            <span class="firstchar">Q</span>uanta Plus is an ambitious open souce project.
            Early on some of our very first developers did not even think it would need a
            help section as it was so intuitive... While I appreciate the optimisim (and
            our code slinging hero may be the exception) we wish to attempt to provide a
            substantial resource here. Documentation is often the last thing to be done in
            open source projects. We would like to step up the level here.
            </p>

            <p><span class="firstchar">T</span>his documentation is being developed on an
            ongoing basis to handle several areas.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Areas of Quanta's interface that may be more confusing like the project section.  </li>
              <li>Assistance in understanding some of the more potentially difficult areas
                like interface customization, scripting and running a PHP debugger.  </li>
              <li>Pointing out the less obvious things like the ability to open projects
                remotely through kio.  </li>
              <li>Giving instruction on how you can customize Quanta (without writing a line
                of C++ and in many cases not even recompiling) with custom tags and documentation. </li>
              <li>Introductory instruction on how to be much more productive with Quanta.  </li>
              <li>Reference information on our design objectives and progress.  </li>
              <li>Developer information for those who might wish to join us.  </li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="firstchar">W</span>e would be remiss not to point out that Quanta
            is being built with volunteer effort. Many people feel they cannot contribute to
            the open source cause for one reason or another. Probably the greatest being a
            feeling they do not have the skills. This documentation is writing in HTML...
            so if you can do that you can help. What is the open source <i>cause</i>? It is
            giving back to the community to grow something bigger than we could on our own,
            but it is also a shining hope for those people around the world where getting
            software for free is not an option, it is <b>the</b> option. We believe in the
            cause!
