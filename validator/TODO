At the moment this uses libxml.

1) Needs to use QtXml (?) when schema validation becomes available in qt.
2) Breaks on certain encodings,
   one way would be to convert it to UTF8 or 16 before validating
3) It is dependent on the mime type names retrieved from the file names rather than the content.
