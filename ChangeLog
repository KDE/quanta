        - rename Edit Toolbar to Configure Toolbars...
        - KFileReplace is used for "Find in Files"
	- Remove From Disc (and Project) renamed to Delete in the Project Tree

  - enhancements/new features:
	- VPL:
	    - speedup of VPL

	    - added tooltips to the scripts (PHP,...) and comments icons indicating their contents
        - warn about missing runtime dependencies
        - make the browser part configuration available from the Settings menu
        - faster switching between documents
        - reworked abbreviation support: abbreviation templates are grouped and one group can
          be valid for more than one DTEP
        - added possibility to mark project files as uploaded [#81546]
        - generate nicer file names when sending some resource in email
        - enable tab reordering with middle mouse button [#80026]
        - added possibility of ignoring the files listed in .cvsignore [#78183]
        - faster parsing and tree building
        - per file and per directory upload status (can be changed from the project treeview
           context menu):
             - When Modified: the item selected for upload if it was modified
             - Never: the item is never selected for upload
             - Confirm: the item is selected for upload if it was modified, but a second confirmation
                             is needed by the user.
          Implements wish #62721.
        - introduce the concept of separate project root and document-base folders.
          Document-base folders hold the documents belonging to the actual project.
          Outside of the document-base folders are project  administrative files, that
          usually are not uploaded. Files under document-base folders are by default
          uploaded (if they were modified), while files outside of the document-base
          folders are not marked to be uploaded, even if they are modified. Exception is
          the directory which holds the project templates, which is marked to be uploaded.
          The user can override the default setting both for files/folder inside and outside of
          a document-base folder. See above.
          For old projects, the project root is the only document folder. The document-base folder
          status can be changed from the project treeview context menu.
          There is a DCOP method to query the root (the document base folder) for a file from
          inside the project: QString WindowManagerIf::documentFolderForURL(QString url).
          Implements wish #64742 (in somewhat different way, but the result is the same).
          The main reasons of document-base folders is to make possible developing for multiple
          subdomains inside the same project and to make a difference between administrative files
          and real (user visible) documents.
        - dragging a tab holding a document puts the document URL in the drag object [#80649]
        - possibility of as-you-type replacing of accented chars [#23164]
        - add support for upload profiles [#54366]
	- create a treeview for each upload profile
        - move the selection to the current file in the project tree [#62878]
        - Reload item added to Documentation->Project Documentation context menu
        - new DCOP interfaces and methods:
             QString WindowManagerIf::documentFolderForURL(QString url);
             QString WindowManagerIf::urlWithPreviewPrefix(QString url);
	- team development support for projects
	- event action support for projects (email, log, script actions)
	- support %userarguments (useful for event arguments) and %projectbase for script actions
	- add possibility to download resources (DTEP, toolbar, script and template packages) from
	  our main server
	- create a new toolbar for easier project view usage
	- basic integrated CVS support (Commit and Update)
	- improved CSS editor
	- several treeview enhancements (inline renaming; tooltips - configurable from the quantarc,
	  ShowToolTips entry; inline editing of descriptions; save and reload the tree state; improved D&D)
	- support for tgz site templates. Site templates are tgz files that can be extracted
	  to an user defined directory.
	- added possibility to configure the preview part (has effect on the whole KHTML, including
	  Konqueror!)
