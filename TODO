Some items that needs to be done:

Urgent fixes:

GUI/framework:
 - fix the parts (editor/html/plugin) GUI addition. Look at the FIXME in quanta.cpp
   before "void QuantaApp::slotFind()"

Parsing:
 - do not reparse the whole document when a <? or <script > or similar thing is
   added. Now the whole reparse is triggered if the parsed (invalid) area has a
   special block without end, like <? without ?> or <script> without </script>.
   This will speed up Quanta.
 - do not reparse the whole special area when something is changed inside.
   Reparse only the changed nodes. This will speed up Quanta.
 - do not reparse the whole file when a text is moved inside the document
   (cut&paste in one step, like when doing d&d). I don't have any idea how to do
   it... This will speed up Quanta.
 - get rid of the global baseNode
 - provide a method to rebuild a specified area (by coordinates or start/end not pairs)

Structure tree:
 - do not delete and rebuild the structure tree when it's not necessary. Delete and rebuild
 only the changed nodes. This will speed up Quanta.

Plugins:
  - Kallery
  - config dialog rework

Misc:
 - WYSIWYG
 - remove unneeded header file dependencies
 - re-structure the files in the project. Now it's quite a mess.
 - fix the session restoration, especially if users still say that
   the current implementation is not acceptable

Bugs discovered:
 - slow editing even for XML (kde-features.xml)
 - autoclosing closes also single (unknown) tags
 - autoclosing does not always closes a tag
 - attribute tree is updated and redrew on every keypress
