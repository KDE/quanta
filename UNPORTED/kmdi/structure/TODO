TODO list
---------

- An adaptor class compatible with QDictIterator
- A config switch to enable debug output of structure code
- Common data structures
  - Tree
    - start writing it
  - Graph
    - take a look at my 3-4 different graph implementations and pick one
  - Trie
    + implemented!
    - make some variations of the data structure (maybe more optimizations)

- Methods to traverse structures
  - This makes the structures more versatile
  - I'm thinking of things like visitor classes that do different kind of ops,
    most important is higher order functions like fold (reduce), map, apply
    STL-style iterators suck, so I'm doing it in better ways

- Sample code
