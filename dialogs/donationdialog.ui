As of September 15, 2002, in addition to his mimimum 10-20 hour a week time commitment, his company, &lt;a href="http://kittyhooch.com" target="_blank"&gt;Kitty Hooch&lt;/a&gt; LLP is the &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; entity with an ongoing financial commitment to Quanta development. This financial support has proven to be &lt;i&gt;crucial&lt;/i&gt; to keeping Quanta in continuous development. It is also a catalyst to our volunteer developers.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kitty Hooch is a small company in it's second year with no employees, 2 active partners, 1 silent partner and several contract workers. After test marketing in the fall of 2001 they began expanding beyond their local market in early 2002. Kitty Hooch controls all aspects of their product from seedling to toy as well as all marketing. In order to realize it's objectives Kitty Hooch has to preserve investment capital to relocate and expand ASAP. Quanta sponsorship is no small expense. While the company has a bright future today is a lot of work and little play.&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balancing open source ideals and fiscal reality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We believe that the open source model is the future of software, but it is no guarantee of success. How many open source projects that we had high hopes for are unmaintained today? How many applications do you think are missing from KDE? In early 2002 the buzz was that Quanta Plus was dead. It's not, but keeping it alive is no easy task. Growing it is very challenging. We believe the key is consistent momentum. Nothing insures this better than a programmer who has no financial or time distractions. Why do you think projects die?&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our ability to increase or sustain full time developers could well rest on your shoulders. As Quanta grows the project management demands are increasing and ironically impacting the revenue stream it requires to continue. The impact of the coding efforts of Andras Mantia, our full time lead developer, has been huge. Just look at CVS. We are looking to sponsor other developers and make Quanta grow even faster. &lt;i&gt;We want to make it the best web tool anywhere and keep you ahead of, not behind, Windows developers&lt;/i&gt;. This will require a nucleous or active core developers. Shrink wrap softare will give way to community driven projects as individuals and companies realize they can get more for less. Some costs are inevitable.&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Could Quanta die without your support?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No! But from February 2001 to June 2002 there was very little activity and many months with no work done at all. Andras first coded for the project in December of 2001. He was sponsored and went full time mid 2002. What if we had we not lost those months? We estimate that contributions from less than 1% of those who download Quanta would easily sponsor two full time developers and help volunteers with needs critical to their development efforts. If we include users who don't build from source we would be expanding Quanta development and branching to other open source projects. We value and pursue volunteer developers, but full time developers are key to driving big projects, &lt;i&gt;just as in KDE and Koffice&lt;/i&gt;. We are anxious to show you what we can do at full speed! Remember, we're not asking you to buy us a beer to say thanks. We're asking you to help us grow the project and continue to fufill all your requests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will you help?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you wish to donate through PayPal (online money transfer or credit card), visit our &lt;a href="http://quanta.sourceforge.net/main1.php?actfile=donate"&gt;donation page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you are outside the PayPal area or wish to discuss corporate sponsorship contact the project manager:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Eric Laffoon, &lt;a href="Eric Laffoon &lt;sequitur@kde.org&gt;"&gt;sequitur@kde.org&lt;/a&gt;</string>
